# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
#### I created this repository for me to use as I go through The Software Developer Boot Camp C# and .NET Course at The Tech Academy. You will notice that I have some rather long file and folder names. Most of the files that stand alone are not to be reviewed by an Instructor so they are just the single file without the framework. The folders have the entire framework included. The idea behind the folder and file names is for me so I can quickly identify what kind of application it is, this is the first part and following the dash is some programing terms that are used in it for my reference. They are not a complete list of programming commands used but just the main point of the assignment. I will give an example:
### üìÅ[ConsoleApp-intStringArrayIntListAddForEach](ConsoleApp-intStringArrayIntListAddForEach) This is a Console Application. It has integer and string arrays. It has integer lists and uses the .Add method and a foreach loop.
#### This helps me as I'm writing code to let me quickly see examples of old code I have used already. At some point when I finish this class, I will rename these projects and files in a more logical and simpler format.
#### Thanks for viewing my code!
